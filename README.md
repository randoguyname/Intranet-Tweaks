# Intranet Tweaks
 Tweaks small details about the CGS student intranet


## Installation
Once you have downloaded this as a zip, unpack it and extract the folder "Intranet Tweaks" – Remember it's location

Then, go into Google Chrome, to the [extensions manager](chrome://extensions/) and in the top right corner, enable "Developer Mode"

Then, click "Load unpacked", and navigate to the folder "Intranet Tweaks", of which you remembered it's location from before.

Hopefully it should be finished

## Usage
After installation, under the default settings of my extension, your student intranet should look something like this:

Note each feature:
* The gold highlighted box is when your music lesson is
* There are breaks in the timetable, highlighted green
* The Zoom meetings are in order from earliest time to latest
* The period numbers (which are broken in the current version of the student intranet) have now been fixed

Note that each feature can enabled/disabled
